        <p>Oh, wanna know about my ðŸ¦˜ story ?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I am a front-end developer and UI designer. I&apos;m working with talented folks at ADL and currently based in Colombo ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°. I like designing for impact and empowering clients in all sizes.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I started my career 5 years ago as a UI/UX Engineer where I was able to work with world leading businesses.</p>
        <br />
        <p>From time to time all through out my career, I worked on design gigs from industries like finance, travel and telecommunication. The exposure made me a better developer and designer who loves to collaborate and learn from all kinds of people.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹</p>
