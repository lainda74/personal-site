        <p>Oh, wanna know about my ðŸ¦˜ story ?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I am from Sri Lanka. I&apos;m working with talented folks at Zuellig Pharma and currently based in Singapore. I like designing for impact and empowering clients in all sizes.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I started my career 8 years ago as a Frontend/UI Engineer where I was able to work with world leading businesses.</p>
        <br />
        <p>From time to time all through out my career, I worked on many projects from industries like finance, travel and telecommunication. The exposure made me a better developer and designer who loves to collaborate and learn from all kinds of people.</p>
